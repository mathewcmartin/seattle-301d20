=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Today we'll code together in an in-class workshop to wire up a new page in our blog app. This is done in lieu of a pair-programming assignment, but you will still need to individually fork/clone the lab code, get it working, and submit a pull request (by Monday at 8:59am) as you have been doing with the paired lab assignments.

Note that we probably will not get to 100% functionality today *(gotta leave y'all a little bit of work to do, right?)*, and also that there may be optional stretch goals.

We'll not work to a schedule, but instead work for an hour or so, take a break, etc., until we finish (or, more accurately, get as close to finished as we're going to get ;-). We should be able to get wrapped up somewhere between 3:00 and 4:00 today.

## Daily Plan

Code review (we'll go until everyone has had a chance to talk about some code)

---

  ```10 minute break```

---

Start working on the form building workshop, go until 11:30 or 11:45 or so, whenever we hit a good stopping point.

---

  ```30-45 minute break```

---

12:15-1:00p: [Partner Power Hour](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/partner-power-hour-tips-for-scoring-your-first-role-as-a-software-developer-tickets-34526163685) with my friend Jason Greer from GeneralUI.

---

  ```15 minute break```

---

1:15p: Resume working on the form workshop (go for an hour or so, until we hit a good stopping point)

---

  ```10 minute break```

---

Finish the workshop around 3:30, +/- 30 minutes or so. You'll have the rest of the day to do the paired portfolio assignment.

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Recap the primary concepts discussed throughout the week.

    * Ask the students "What have you learned so far?"

    * Ask "What has been challenging?"

    * Ask "What has been helpful?"

* Work through a form-based exercise to build out a JSON string.

* Discuss 3rd party library integration for dynamic code highlighting and markdown creation.
