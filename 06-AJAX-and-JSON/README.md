=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

- Here we go! Onwards, into Week 2 and a study of the **Model** layer. Asynchronous connections... and standardized data formats? This all sounds like a serious upgrade to our application logic! Let's see what you can do with the blog app and your portfolios once we apply these concepts!

- This week, you will construct a model layer in your application that accesses and transforms persisted data, conforming to common WRRC, FP, and CRUD conventions.

- Starting with an introduction to the WRRC (web request response cycle), we will learn how HTTP works and how to accomplish simple GET requests through the use of AJAX and jQuery.

- One more thing: ES2015 syntax for variable declarations! `let` and `const` join the party.

## Daily Plan

- How are everyone's Postgres setups? We need those solid by Wednesday. If you had problems during installation/setup, let's address those in the next couple of days.


- Code Review/Q&A (let's try to keep it short, because there is a load of new stuff to get to today)
- Slides: AJAX & JSON Overview
	- The HTTP Party
	- JSON
	- AJAX

`10-minute break`

- *(finish slides if needed)*
- Key points of the readings that we'll need, and demo some of them:
	- Duckett JS book, pp.367-408
		- p.370: What is [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(mythology))?
		- p.371: Why use AJAX?
		- p.372: **How AJAX works**
		- p.373: Handling AJAX requests and responses *("vanilla AJAX")*
		- p.374: Data formats *(All you need to know is that JSON rules)*
		- p.376: JSON
		- p.382: Loading JSON with AJAX
		- p.388: **jQuery & AJAX: requests**
		- p.389: **jQuery & AJAX: responses**
		- p.392: jQuery's AJAX shorthand methods
		- p.408: **Summary of the AJAX & JSON chapter**

- **AJAX demo**

`10-minute break`

- Lab Prep
	- Let's review the starter code and TODOs!
	- But first, let's look at the working solution.
	- Note that this code uses new ES6 styles of variable declarations including  `let` and `const`

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Identify when apps need persistence, to improve the UX and isolate the model logic in the code base.

* Explain how the browser uses the request-response (WRRC) cycle to render an HTML file or AJAX call.

* Analyze the localStorage object
